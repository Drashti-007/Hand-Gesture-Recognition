# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
This project demonstrates how to control LEDs using hand gestures through a combination of Python, OpenCV, and the Arduino Uno microcontroller. Hand gestures are recognized via a webcam and processed with MediaPipe, a library designed for hand-tracking and gesture recognition. Each detected gesture is mapped to an LED control command, such as turning LEDs on or off. This allows for interactive control of the LEDs with simple hand movements.

# Components Required
1. Arduino Uno Board ( Arduino Uno is used as the controller for handling commands sent based on the hand gestures recognized by the camera )
2. LEDs (5 pieces) for each finger (Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky)
3. Resistors (Five 220 Ohms for each LEDs )
4. Jumper wires ( Male to Female )

5. Breadboard
